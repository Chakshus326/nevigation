🚀 Just Wrapped Up a Fun JavaScript Project! 🧑‍💻🗺️

Built a mini web app using JavaScript + Google Maps API that does something we all secretly want:
➡️ Detects your current location
🛒 Shows nearby grocery stores instantly
🧭 And yes, it can even guide you there with just one click!

This was a great hands-on learning experience with geolocation, APIs, and user-centric design. 🌐💡
